Welcome to the Spring Olympics!

Inside of each of five sections you will find a place labelled "YOU:". You
must fill in the missing code there with the code described. All of your
code will be in each of the five functions up at the top of the code.

DO NOT MODIFY ANY CODE IN THE MAIN FUNCTION
ONLY MODIFY CODE IN THE FIVE FUNCTIONS SET UP FOR YOU (first, second, etc.)

If you are curious what the code will look like when it is running properly,
here is some sample input and output. The first number is the choice of event,
the following numbers are typed in at the prompts (which are not shown):
----------------------------------------
Event 1 input: 1 3 4
Event 1 ouput: The result is: 25
----------------------------------------
Event 2 input: 2 2 3
Event 2 output: The result is: 18
----------------------------------------
Event 3 input: 3 1 2 3 4 5 0
Event 3 output: The sum of all the numbers is: 15
----------------------------------------
Event 4 input: 4 1 2 3 4 5 7 0
Event 4 ouput: The number of odd numbers typed in is: 4
----------------------------------------
Event 5 input: 5 5
Event 5 output: 0 1 2 3 4
