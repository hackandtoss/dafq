    Door Jedi Program #1 Go Go Go
*************************************

The goal of this program is to teach you how to transition from having an idea
in your head of what a program should do into actually implementing it.

For this assignment you will need to do the following to earn your A:

1) Think about what goes into an automatic door opener at a grocery store or
gas station. I've given you a simple FSA diagram showing the transitions
between four states. You must think up and add at least two more states to the
conceptual diagram, and draw arrows showing how you can transition into and out
of the states.

To get credit: Have at least six states with transitions between them.

2) You must sketch out your A) States and B) Transitions between States on a
sheet of paper. Circle the starting state. (For example: "CLOSED".) Make sure
each transition is labelled with what event must take place to cause the
transition, like "Door on Fire" or "Door hit something" or "Sensor detected
door fully open".

To get credit: Turn in your paper diagram to me

3) Write code to implement your diagram. Every state and transition on your
paper will become code on your project. States will probably be held in a variable
(which I call "state" in your sample program, very creative I know), and
transitions will be events. By default, the user will enter an event from the
keyboard, and then your system must respond to the event and print out what
state the system is in.

For example, if the user enters "lock" (and you have a
LOCKED state) then this represents the owner locking the door for the night,
and you need to stop opening the door every time a person walks up. It will
probably ignore all events other than "unlock".

Some sample events you might want to handle:
"Person" (a person walks up to the door)
"Fire" (the door has caught on fire)
"Lock" (the owner locks the door for the night)
"Unlock" (the owner unlocks the door in the morning)
Etc. 

What events you actually implement depends on your state diagram.

To get credit: implement every state and transition on your diagram.

4) I have given you a function that waits three seconds. Your door must take
three seconds to open, stay open three seconds, and three seconds to close.
This function will let your code take the correct amount of time (and not just
print out opening... open... closing... closed all at once).

The wait function must NOT be used in the interrupt handler, or you lose this
point.

To get credit: Use the wait_three_seconds() function properly.

Extra credit: If you want to be extra cool, modify the wait_three_seconds()
function so that if someone walks through the door when it is open, it will reset the timer.

5) You must use an interrupt handler.

I have given you a function that will be called any time the user hits
ctrl-c: signal_handler(). If you look at the top of main(), you'll see that I
set it up using the signal() function so that if an interrupt signal (ctrl-c)
is sent to the program, rather than killing the program, it will instead call
the signal handler.

Signal_handler() gets passed the number of the signal, in case you
want to handle multiple signals - for example, you might want to make it so
that ctrl-c represents a person coming in through the door, but a ctrl-z
represents the door catching on fire. (Ctrl-c will send a 2, for SIGINT, and
ctrl-z will send a 20 for SIGTSTP.) 

We need this because otherwise our door will be very boring - send a person in
through the front door, let it cycle through opening, open, closing, yawn,
closed. With a signal handler, now we can have another person enter the door
at any time, and you must handle it correctly.

To get credit: Implement a single signal (ctrl-c).
Extra credit: Implement multiple signals.

****************************************

Extra credit (+10%):
Do the same thing, but implement a gas pump. It should have at least 10
states, representing swiping a credit card, taking the dispenser off the hook, 
selecting an octane, and so forth.
